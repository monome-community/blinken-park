blinken park creates random, modally-constrained MIDI notes (and lights) The monome button grid provides two axes of interaction: birth rate (how often new notes/LED form) and persistence (note/led duration).

It wasn't really designed as musical tool, it grew out of a need to create a long photo exposure of the 256.
